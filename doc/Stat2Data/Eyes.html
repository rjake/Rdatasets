<h2>Pupil Dilation and Sexual Orientation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from an experiment relating pupil dilation to sexual orientation.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 106 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>DilateDiff</code></dt><dd><p>Difference in pupil dilation when looking at same-sex and opposite-sex nude photographs</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Sex</code></dt><dd><p><code>F</code>=female or <code>M</code>=male</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Gay</code></dt><dd><p><code>1</code>=gay or <code>0</code>=not, based on Kinsey scale score greater than 3</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SexMale</code></dt><dd><p><code>0</code>=female or <code>1</code>=male</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Details</h3>

<p>DilateDiff is, essentially, the difference in pupil dilation when looking at (a) same-sex nudes and (b) opposite-sex nude photographs. More specifically, multiple measurements of pupil size were taken under each of the two conditions, together with a third condition that involved a neutral stimulus. Within-subject z-scores were then computed, which led to the DilateDiff numbers used here.
